# Advanced Usage of the Networking Library

This document covers more complex scenarios and advanced features of the networking library, including asynchronous message handling, multi-threading, and performance optimization techniques. Understanding these concepts will help you leverage the full potential of the library in your applications.

## Asynchronous Message Handling

Asynchronous message handling allows your application to continue processing while waiting for messages to be sent or received. This is particularly useful in networking applications where latency can occur due to network delays. The library provides functions to handle messages asynchronously, enabling you to manage multiple connections without blocking the main execution thread.

### Key Functions

- `recvMSGAsync(connection_t connection)`: This function listens for incoming messages on a given connection in a separate thread. It continuously checks for new messages and adds them to the connection's message buffer.

- `sendMSG(int clientID, std::vector<t> &data)`: This function sends messages to a client without blocking the main thread. It prepares the data and writes it to the socket associated with the client.

### Example Usage

To implement asynchronous message handling, you can create a separate thread for receiving messages while your main application logic continues to run. This allows for a responsive user interface or other processing tasks.

```cpp
std::thread recvThread(recvMSGAsync, connection);
recvThread.detach(); // Detach the thread to run independently
```

## Multi-threading

Multi-threading is essential for handling multiple client connections simultaneously. The library uses C++ threads to manage connections, allowing each client to be processed in its own thread. This improves performance and responsiveness, especially in applications with high concurrency.

### Managing Threads

- **Creating Threads**: Use `std::thread` to create a new thread for each client connection. This allows the server to handle multiple clients at once.

- **Joining Threads**: Ensure that threads are properly joined or detached to avoid resource leaks. Use `thread.join()` to wait for a thread to finish execution before proceeding.

### Example Implementation

In the server implementation, you can spawn a new thread for each accepted client connection:

```cpp
void handleClient(int clientSocket) {
    // Handle client communication
}

while (true) {
    int clientSocket = accept(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr*)&clientAddr, &addrLen);
    std::thread clientThread(handleClient, clientSocket);
    clientThread.detach(); // Handle the client in a separate thread
}
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

To enhance the performance of your networking application, consider the following techniques:

1. **Buffer Management**: Efficiently manage message buffers to minimize memory allocation and deallocation. Reuse buffers when possible to reduce overhead.

2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple messages in a single operation to reduce the number of system calls. This can significantly improve throughput.

3. **Connection Pooling**: Maintain a pool of reusable connections to reduce the overhead of establishing new connections. This is particularly useful in high-load scenarios.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage connection failures and unexpected disconnections. This ensures that your application remains stable under adverse conditions.

## Conclusion

By utilizing asynchronous message handling, multi-threading, and performance optimization techniques, you can build efficient and responsive networking applications using the library. Experiment with these advanced features to fully harness the capabilities of your networking solution.
