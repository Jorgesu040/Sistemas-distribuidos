## Overview

The Networking Utils Library is designed to help developers create robust networked applications with ease. It abstracts many of the complexities involved in socket programming, allowing you to focus on building your application logic.

## Installation

To use the Networking Utils Library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd networking-utils
   ```
3. Compile the examples to see how the library works:
   ```
   g++ examples/*.cpp -o examples/output
   ```

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs` directory. Here are the key documents:

- **[Basic Concepts](docs/basic-concepts.md)**: Learn about fundamental networking concepts such as IP addresses, ports, protocols (TCP/UDP), and sockets.
- **[Client Guide](docs/client-guide.md)**: Step-by-step instructions on using the client functionalities of the library.
- **[Server Guide](docs/server-guide.md)**: Instructions on setting up a server using the library.
- **[Data Structures](docs/data-structures.md)**: Detailed descriptions of the data structures used in the library.
- **[Messaging Guide](docs/messaging-guide.md)**: Information on sending and receiving messages asynchronously.
- **[Advanced Usage](docs/advanced-usage.md)**: Explore more complex scenarios and advanced features of the library.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains sample implementations to help you get started:

- **[Simple Client](examples/simple-client.cpp)**: A basic client implementation that connects to a server and sends a message.
- **[Simple Server](examples/simple-server.cpp)**: A basic server implementation that accepts client connections and responds to messages.
- **[Async Server](examples/async-server.cpp)**: An asynchronous server that handles multiple clients simultaneously.

## Images

Visual aids are available in the `images` directory:

- **[Client-Server Diagram](images/client-server-diagram.svg)**: Illustrates the client-server architecture and data flow.
- **[Message Flow](images/message-flow.svg)**: Depicts the sequence of operations during communication between clients and the server.

## Slides

An introductory presentation summarizing the library's features and usage can be found in the `slides` directory:
